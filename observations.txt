Observation 1
After plotting each city's latitude vs. its max temperature for Jan. 8, 2019, there appears to be an obvious trend 
showing the temperature dropping as the latitude grows larger (on the positive side). Though obvious, the data shows 
that the temperature for cities that are located north of the Tropic of Cancer (~23 degrees North latitude) is lower than
the temperature in cities located between the Equator and the Tropic of Cancer (0 to 23 degrees). The data also shows somewhat 
that the temperature does not drop drastically as the latitude grows larger (on the negative side), as it is currently sumer in 
the Southern Hemisphere. Even for cities located at 40 degrees South latitude, the temperature is still sitting between 40 and 
85 degrees F. 


Observation 2
Based on the plot of cities' latitude vs. their wind speeds on Jan. 8, 2019, it appears there is not a strong
correlation bewteen latitude and wind speeds. In general, wind speeds for most cities were between 0 and 20 MPH,
though some cities in the more northern and southern extremes did have drastically higher wind speeds. The data
says to me that these outlier wind speeds are caused by local conditions like terrain rather than latitude.


Observation 3
Based on the plot of cities' latitude vs. their humidity levels, it appears there is not a strong correlation
between latitude and humidity. Almost all cities within the Tropics (-23 degrees to 23 degrees) registered 
humidity levels of at least 20 percent, though some cities located outside the tropics registered lower 
humidity levels. Again, the data shows that these outlier humidity levels are likely caused by local conditions,
like proximity to water and temperature, rather than latitude. (The same appears to be true about the correlation 
between latitude and wind speed)
